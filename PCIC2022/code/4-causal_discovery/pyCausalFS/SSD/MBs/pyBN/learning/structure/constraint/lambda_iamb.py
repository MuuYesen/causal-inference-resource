	"""
	Lambda IAMB Algorithm for learning the structure of a
	Discrete Bayesian Network from data. This Algorithm
	is similar to the iamb algorithm, except that it allows
	for a "lambda" coefficient that helps avoid false positives.

	This algorithm was originally developed for use as a
	feature selection algorithm - discovering the markov
	blanket of a target variable is equivalent to discovering
	the relevant features for classifications.

	In practice, this algorithm does just as well as a feature
	selection method compared to IAMB when naive bayes was 
	used as a classifier, but Lambda-iamb actually does much
	better than traditional iamb when traditional iamb does
	very poorly due to high false positive rates.

	Arguments
	---------
	*data* : a nested numpy array

	*L* : a float
		The lambda hyperparameter - see [1].

	*alpha* : a float
		The type II error rate.

	Returns
	-------
	*bn* : a BayesNet object

	Effects
	-------
	None
