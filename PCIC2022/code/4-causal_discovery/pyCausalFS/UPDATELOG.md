* 1. We have replaced the conditional independence (CI)  test from Chi^2 test to G^2 test, due to the poor performance of the Chi^2 test on some BN datasets. If the test results are different from the illustrations in the manual, the actual test results shall prevail. By the way, if you have better CI test for this open-source package or other suggestions, please contact us. Email: huwentao2013@foxmail.com.
* 2. We have fixed some bug in the feature selection approaches.
* 3. We have added some global BN structure learning algorithms.
* 4. We will update the manual next.
