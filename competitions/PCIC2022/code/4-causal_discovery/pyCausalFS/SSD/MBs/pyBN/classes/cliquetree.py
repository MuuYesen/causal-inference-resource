******************
CliqueTree Class 
&
Clique Class
******************

This is a class for creating/manipulating Junction (Clique) Trees,
and performing inference over them. The advantage of clique trees
over traditional variable elimination over the original Bayesian 
network is that clique trees allow you to compute marginal
probabilities of MULTIPLE variables without having to run the
entire algorithm over. 

Therefore, if you have to query the Bayesian network many times 
-- and you want the exact marginal values -- then it might be 
best to use the clique tree data structure for inference.
If you need to compute the marginal distribution for all variables,
but you dont mind an approximate, a sampling algorithm is probably
the way to go.

In general, the junction tree algorithms generalize 
Variable Elimination to the efficient, simultaneous execution 
of a large class of queries.

NOTE: A cluster graph is a generalization of the clique tree
data structure - to generate a clique tree, you first generate
a cluster graph, then simply calculate a maximum spanning tree.
In other words, a clique tree can be considered as a special
type of cluster graph.
